# Baseball-Analysis
This Repository contains R code that can be used to perform a variety of analyses on baseball history and performance.

Included in this repository is data courtesy of Retrosheet and the Chadwick Project. This is a large R Dataframe, so it could take time to load. To use this dataframe, run source("data-set-up.R"). To get game data or ID keys, run load("data/games.Rda") or load("data/keys.Rda"), respectively.

The information used here was obtained free of charge from and is copyrighted by Retrosheet.  Interested parties may contact Retrosheet at 20 Sunset Rd., Newark, DE 19711.

The Chadwick source code is managed using git, at https://github.com/chadwickbureau/chadwick.
